                Dedicate yourself to lifelong fucking learning. Never, never assume that what you have achieved
                is fucking good enough. Paul Rand once said, “The public is more familiar with bad fucking design than good
                design. It is, in effect, conditioned to prefer bad design, because that is what it lives with.
                The new becomes threatening, the old reassuring.” Don’t get hung up on things that don’t fucking work.
                The details are not the details. They make the fucking design. Make your work consistent but not fucking predictable.
                While having drinks with Tibor Kalman one night, he told me, “When you make something no one hates, no one fucking loves it.”</p>

            <p> You are not your fucking work. You won’t get good at anything by doing it a lot fucking       aimlessly.
                Widows and orphans are terrible fucking tragedies, both in real life and definitely in typography.
                Don’t worry about what other people fucking think. To go partway is easy, but mastering anything requires hard
                fucking work. If you’re not being fucking honest with yourself how could you ever hope to communicate
                something meaningful to someone else?
                Can we all just agree as the greater design community to stop fucking talking about Comic Sans</p>
